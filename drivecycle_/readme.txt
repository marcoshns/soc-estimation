Driving Cycle (Simulink Block)
by Daniel Auger
Produces NEDC, Artemis, WLTP Class 3 and selected EPA driving cycles

This submission contains a Simulink block that can produce several different standard driving cycles used for automotive emissions, range and energy consumption testing. Using this block might save time and effort - I am sharing it to speed up student simulation classes and projects. 

At present, the block represents the following cycles: NEDC, Artemis, WLTP Class 3, UDDS, FTP and HWFET. It could easily be extended to provide more.

If you download this as a zip archive, you will need to unzip this and save the files on your computer.  After that, you may need to use the 'install.m' script to make sure all the toolbox directories are on your MATLAB search path.
